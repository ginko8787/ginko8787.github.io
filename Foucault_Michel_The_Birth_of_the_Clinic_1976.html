By operating a</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y61 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls1d8 wse0">process of selection, it alters in its very nature the way in which the</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y62 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls1b6 ws66">disease is manifested, and the relationship between the disease and the</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y63 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls1b6 ws2ae">patient; in the hospital one is dealing with individuals who happen to</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y64 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls31 ws2c">be suffering from one disease or another; the role of the hospital</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y65 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls1b2 ws2af">doctor is to discover the disease in the patient; and this interiority of</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y66 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls8b ws2c">the disease means that it is often buried in the patient, concealed</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y67 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls1c2 ws2b0">within him like a cryptogram.

The difference between this investigation and the ‘clinical</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y62 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls5a ws44">examination’ lies in the fact that in the former no inventory of a</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y63 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls2d ws2b7">sick organism is made; one retains those elements that enable one to</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y64 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls2d ws1fc">put one’s hand on an ideal key—a key that has four functions, since</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y65 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls125 ws44">it is a mode of designation, a principle of coherence, a law of</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y66 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls28a ws2c">evolution, and a body of precepts. In other words, the gaze that</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y67 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls2a ws60">traverses a sick body attains the truth that it seeks only by passing</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y68 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls47 wsa6">through the dogmatic stage of the <span class="ff7 ls2fa ws3">name,</span><span class="ls2a ws2b8"> in which a double truth is</span></div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y69 ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls20a ws29">contained: the hidden, but already present truth of the disease and</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y6a ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls27a ws29">the enclosed truth that is clearly deducible from the outcome and</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y6b ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 lsbc ws27">from the means. So it is not the gaze itself that has the power of</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y6c ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls2a ws164">analysis and synthesis, but the synthetic truth of language, which is</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y6d ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls2cd ws2c">added from the outside, as a reward for the vigilant gaze of the</div><div class="t m0 x7 h3 y6e ff6 fs1 fc0 sc0 ls155 ws27">student.
